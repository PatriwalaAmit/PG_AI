Problem Statement: 

Suppose you are a public school administrator. Some schools in your state of Tennessee are performing 
below average academically. Your superintendent under pressure from frustrated parents and voters approached 
you with the task of understanding why these schools are under-performing. 

To improve school performance, you need to learn more about these schools and their students, just as a business 
needs to understand its own strengths and weaknesses and its customers. The data includes various demographic, 
school faculty, and income variables. 

Objective: 

Perform exploratory data analysis which includes: determining the type of the data, correlation analysis 
over the same. 

You need to convert the data into useful information: 

▪ Read the data in pandas data frame 
▪ Describe the data to find more details 
▪ Find the correlation between ‘reduced_lunch’and‘school_rating’
